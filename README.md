# Quick Task for VS Code

Quick Task will automatically trawl your project directory for task scripts, e.g. npm, gulp, shell, python, ruby, powershell, perl scripts etc... and allow you to execute each task with the click of a mouse!

The days of having to configure a task runner per project, or manually type out task scripts are over!
