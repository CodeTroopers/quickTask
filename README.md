# Quick Task for VS Code

> Based on [Task Master](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ianhoney.task-master)

Quick Task will automatically trawl your project directory for task scripts,
e.g. npm, gulp, shell, bat, python, ruby, powershell, perl scripts etc...
and allow you to execute each task with the click of a mouse!

As shown bellow, all tasks will showup after click the task button on statusbar and you can
execute any item simply by clicking it.

Highlights:
- Auto rescan after task files changed / added / deleted.
- Allow you to close terminal window automatically after execution.
